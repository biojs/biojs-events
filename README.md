event system
------------------

This is a convenience wrapper for the [Event system](https://github.com/biojs/biojs2/wiki/Event-systems).

You can choose any library that supports the choosen syntax.

This wrapper here is for [`backbone-events-standalone`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/backbone-events-standalone) and thus the Backbone event system.
